Recommender systems are both socially and economically important in ensuring that people can make informed decisions about the content they consume on a daily basis. This is particularly true in the case of movie recommendations.\n\nProviding an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has enormous economic potential, with users of the system receiving personalized recommendations, thereby enhancing platform affinity for the streaming services that best facilitate their audience's viewing.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### RECOMMENDER SYSTEM","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A recommendation system is an information filtering system whose main goal is to predict the rating or preference a user might give to an item. This helps create personalized content and better product search experience. One popular use is recommending to users which movie to watch. This is because significant dependencies exist between users and item centric activity. For example a user who is interested in s historical documentary is more likely to be interested in another historical documentary or an educational program, rather than in an action movie.\n\nA recommendation system can use either of these two techniques:\n\n- Content based filtering\n- Collaborative filtering\n\nIn content based filtering, the algorithm seeks to make recommendations based on how similar the properties or features of an item are to other items.\n\nIn collaborative filtering, we use similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations. This allows for serendipitous recommendations; that is, collaborative filtering models can recommend an item to user A based on the interests of a similar user B.\n\nHere we are going to explore both methods and assess which recommendation system gives us the best results. Increasing sales is the primary goal of a recommender system. By recommending carefully selected items to users, recommender systems bring relevant items to the attention of users. This increases the sales volumes and profits to the merchants.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div id='tbl-contents'>\n    <h2>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2>\n    <ol>\n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#introduction'>Introduction</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#load-dependencies'>Load Dependencies</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#load-data'>Load Data</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li> \n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#sneak-peek'>Sneak Peek into Loaded Data</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li> \n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#data-cleaning'>Data Cleaning</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li> \n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#eda'>Exploratory Data Analysis</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li>  \n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#FE'>Feature Engineering</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li>  \n        <li>\n            <h4>\n                <a href='#recommender'>Recommender Systems</a>\n            </h4>\n        </li>  \n    </ol>\n</div>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div>\n    <h4><a href='#tbl-contents'>Back to table of contents</a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id='load-dependencies'>\n    <h2>LOAD DEPENDENCIES</h2>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os # for os operations on kaggle\n\n# for pattern searching and extraction \nimport re\n\n# libraries for data analysis and manipulation\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# libraries for numerical efficiencies\nimport scipy as sp\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# libraries for string matching\nfrom fuzzywuzzy import fuzz\nfrom fuzzywuzzy import process\n\n# libraries for data visualizations\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import figure\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n\n# library to evaluate strings containing python literals\nfrom ast import literal_eval\n\n# libraries for natural language processing\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet\nfrom nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\nfrom nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer\n\n# libraries for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.\nfrom surprise import Reader, Dataset, SVD\nfrom surprise import KNNBasic, BaselineOnly, NMF\n\n# libraries for entity featurization and similarity computation\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel, cosine_similarity\nfrom surprise.model_selection import cross_validate, train_test_split\n\n# to ignore whatever warnings that may arise\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 10) # defaulting all plots to a fixed size\nsns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(15,10)})\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\nsns.set_palette(\"Blues_r\")\n# sns.set_palette(sns.dark_palette(\"#69d\"))\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"id":"jJoKzyWPDpVd","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T20:34:30.072390Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T20:34:30.072646Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T20:34:30.100371Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T20:34:30.072614Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T20:34:30.099670Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div>\n    <h4><a href='#tbl-contents'>Back to table of contents</a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id='load-data'>\n    <h2>LOAD DATASETS</h2>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert_columns(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes in a dataset and converts the \n    dtype of each column to a lesser version to reduce\n    the size of the dataset for further operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    for col in data.columns: # iterate over the columns in the dataset\n        \n        if data[col].dtype == 'object':\n            data[col] = data[col].astype('category') # convert objects to categories\n        \n        if data[col].dtype == 'int64':\n            data[col] = data[col].astype('int32') # convert int64 to int32\n        \n        if data[col].dtype == 'float64':\n            data[col] = data[col].astype('float32') # convert float64 to float32\n        \n    return data # return converted data\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T20:34:34.292668Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T20:34:34.293022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T20:34:34.301933Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T20:34:34.292981Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T20:34:34.300947Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading datasets.

First, What are Lemmatization and Stemming?\n\n\nLemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meanings to one word.\n\nStemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers. A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem “retrieve”. This is very important because we want similar words grouped, to give our algorithm a better accuracy\n\nBoth Lemming and Stemming both take as inputs, tokenized words.\n\nTokenization is a process of converting a string of words into a list of separated individual words.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets define our tokenizer\n\ndef tokenize(text):\n    return text.split(' ')\n\n# Lemming and stemming function\n\ndef transform(text):\n    # tokenize words\n    words = tokenize(text)\n    \n    # define both Lemmatizer and stemmer\n    lemmer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    stemmer = SnowballStemmer(language='english')\n    \n    # lemmatize and stem words\n    lemmatized = [lemmer.lemmatize(x) for x in words]\n    stemmed = [stemmer.stem(x) for x in lemmatized]\n    \n    return ' '.join(stemmed)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.728674Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.729483Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.736000Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.729439Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.735318Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":102,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# fill null values with blanks\nfull_movies[['movie_description', 'plot_keywords', 'tag']] = full_movies[['movie_description', 'plot_keywords', 'tag']].fillna('')\n# apply transform function to text columns\nfull_movies['movie_description'] = full_movies['movie_description'].apply(transform)\nfull_movies['plot_keywords'] = full_movies['plot_keywords'].apply(transform)\nfull_movies['tag'] = full_movies['tag'].apply(transform)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.737219Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.737448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.620176Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:21:37.737420Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.618972Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":103,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check number and percentage of missing data\n\n# Extract the number of missing data and the percentage\n# of missing data and concatenate into one dataframe\nfull_movies_missing = pd.concat([full_movies.isnull().sum(), round(full_movies.isnull().sum()/full_movies.shape[0] * 100)], axis=1)\nfull_movies_missing.columns = ['missing_count', 'missing_percentage'] # rename columns\nfull_movies_missing","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.622353Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.622738Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.752054Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.622679Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.750715Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":104,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def fill_na(df):\n    \n    # iterate over columns in the dataframe\n    for column in df.columns:\n        # impute based on the type of column\n        if df[column].dtype == 'object':\n            # fill categorical columns with blanks\n            df[column] = df[column].fillna('')\n        elif df[column].dtype == 'float32' or df[column].dtype == 'float64':\n            # fill numerical columns with the mean value of the column\n            df[column] = df[column].fillna(df[column].mean())\n    #return dataframe\n    return df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.753602Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.753839Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.762248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.753802Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.760967Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":105,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# apply fill_na function\nfull_movies = fill_na(full_movies)\n\nfull_movies.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.764131Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.764650Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.923391Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.764604Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.922331Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":106,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check if fill_na worked.\nfull_movies_missing = pd.concat([full_movies.isnull().sum(), round(full_movies.isnull().sum()/full_movies.shape[0] * 100)], axis=1)\nfull_movies_missing.columns = ['missing_count', 'missing_percentage'] # rename columns\nfull_movies_missing","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.924899Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.925160Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T19:22:53.057974Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T19:22:52.925130Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T19:22:53.056995Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":107,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Fill_na worked a charm.
